Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Split the module into 2:
- product_set:
for defining the base models and menus in neutral places (like settings part), that can be hosted in OCA/product-attribute or OCA/product-pack.
- sale_product_set:
adding the menu in sales part, and the wizard.


That way, we don't have to install sale if for example we only want the sets in projects.
