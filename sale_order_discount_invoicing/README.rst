Configuration
=============

To use the module you need to:

* allow sale lines splitting (if discounted) in the sales configuration
* configure a discount account on the product category or product template (according to you needs)

Usage
=====

On a sale order, set the origin price unit.

When an invoice is created, the unit price is accounted for in the income
