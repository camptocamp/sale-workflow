This module allows configuring a specific account for the accounting of
discounts, which can be required in some localization (or by some accountants,
especialy in the e-commerce sector).

A sale line with a normal price of 100 and a reduced price of 80 (VAT 20% incl.) generates 3 account moves:

* 100 the product income account
* -20 on the product discount and rebates account
* 13.33 on the VAT account
